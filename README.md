# Introduction
This is a permanent fork of the Clever Package that is getting a overhaul and introducing namespaces and OOP best practices as much as I have time for. Credit goes to Clever for the heavy lifting on this one. It is a fork that will likely break users that are currently working with the current code. This will make it easier to integrate with frameworks like Laravel and Drupal.
