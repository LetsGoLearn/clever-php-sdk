## Installation & Usage

### Composer

If you don't use Composer you might want to look into it... If you use composer we follow the same versioning system that Clever does so v2.1 will be API V2.1 ... do I need to make everyone a chart... I will let people decide how they want to install it. I do fun cache/parrelel Composer for speeds on the Interwebs.

## Damn Work In Progress

This does use the simple Swagger API implemention for the SDK maintained by Clever. I will be working on a docker implamentation for forking and processing updates. While this does start here it could morph into more if I find help in maintaining and adjusting it. Maybe it goes away from Swagger or maybe a custom config file for adjusted builds. Sky's the limit people.
